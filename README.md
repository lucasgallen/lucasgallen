### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is _Lucas_. I'm an American living abroad, currently based in Dakar, Senegal. When I'm not coding I might be working on the next novel, fermenting foods, or playing boardgames. I've been building web sites and web apps for more than 5 years. By now I can work with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** like a second nature and have built upon that foundation by expanding my engineering knowledge into the backend with **Ruby on Rails** and dabbling into DevOps when I can. My current passion however is building pages with **React.js** and dipping my toes into the Jamstack paradigm.

During the pandemic I've built three projects:
- https://sivumbike.com (**Ruby on Rails**, **Turbolinks**, **Docker**)
- https://anim8.us (**Ruby on Rails**, **React.js**, **React-Redux**, **Docker**)
- https://lomanart.com (**Nextjs**, **Netlify**)
 
I would love any opportunity that allows me to continue my professional growth with the React ecosystem, even more so if that also means other opportunities to further grow with backend or devOps technologies. I'm well-disciplined, self-driven, and eager to start the next step in my career. I have been working remotely for more than two years and am very comfortable in that space. Cheers!
